# CalderonEITFEM
Creates Training Data for Calderon/EIT Problem using FEM-solver.

1. Contains Methods for generating conductivity, and boundary conditions:
Based on white noise with gaussian filtering. 
Alternatively uses Gaussian Random fields. 


2. Creates Rectangular/Square or circular Mesh with varying granularity.

3. Calculates FEM Solution of both Dirichlet-to-Neumann and Neumann-to-Dirichlet
